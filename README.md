## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

In my Design practice, player can learn the mechanic of my game. In first section of my game, I set basic elements that player can learning how to play around in this game, there is elements such as, spikes, acid, and enemies, that could make player loss lives, also there are health pick-up, walkthrough platform that they need to learn how they can play around with my toy. The process that they learn concept of game is the goal of scaffold discovery in a game. When I design each encounter in my game, there always one skill challenge, this provide a clear learning goal for player with each of encounter, then they can quickly learn my game mechanics. Once player familiar with core game rules, then they can capture skills when they play the next level of game, so I arise the difficulty of level design, make sure player learn new skills with new elements, and different levels.

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

The intensity curve of my game is sequentially increase when the level increase. At start of game, fundamental gameplay presented in first section, low intensity provides a safe environment for player learning the game rules of game, we can see it just simple jumping movement, leading player towards the game rules. When player entry second section, that they should have general skill of gameplay, so I increased intensity, which I made narrative encounter explorations, to make player feeling the challenge, things like solve puzzles, doge attract from spitter, efficiently increasing the intensity and difficulty. Third section of game, it is highest point of intensity. Huge acid with challenge platform jumping, difficulty boss fight room, they both arise the intensity between the gameplays. The story of whole game, that player can feel the experience during the intensity increase, there is no narration inside game, it still can see a brief structure of an adventure story telling.

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

The main challenge of this game is players’ proficiency of gameplay skill. The idea of my game is a 2D platform game, proficiency of physical gameplay skill is always biggest challenge for players, based on this purpose, narrative platform movement is applied in game. To control the flow of gameplay, I gives immediate feedback such as health pick and weapons for player to uses, especially when I do the iterative design of my game test, things like setting more rewards, changes in between challenges, that balance the difficulty of the game. Also, it is important to set a check point before a higher level for player, it is decreasing the tension of challenge, so player can have a break until they start next challenge, it is way of how we temper the dynamic difficulty. With this process of challenge taking place, player improved their skills of gameplay, and immersion their self into the game, this how challenge works in my game.

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

Making a distinct mapping and setting interesting rewards, this is how I invite the player to explore my game. Clearly mapping inside my game, provide a good guideline for player, they can lead by map and explore area in between game, that they are not confused themselves. An open space in second section has been created with a big tree, an open area with beautiful land view may facilitate players’ curious, this one of my memorable design for player spend most time on this game. And connection area with bunch of rewards, gives them opportunities of explorations. The entry of third section, was hide with destructible block, this one of setting that I want player have fun with their explorations. Exploration inside game provide a fun of playing, surprises made for players will give them memorable gameplay experiences.

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Spikes

Spikes is a trap around map, when you jump or step on it, you will loss health, also you will bounce back after you hit the spikes. So you should jump over spikes or avoid spikes.

### 2.3. Acid
Acid a poison pool in the game, when you jump into acid, you will dead and respawn from start or checkpoint, you should jump over Acid anytime.
![Acid](https://github.com/COMP2150-24s1/level-design-assessment-lilfengfeng/assets/106721448/872adc77-7be9-43af-b972-108e0924e8cc)



### 2.4. Health Pickups
Health pickups is item that you can get health back, when you loss your health, sometimes it could save you for a whiles.

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

At start of my game design, I designed it with a brief structure and required items setting inside, there was three parts of game, a linear challenge platform game, with little bit change in between them, there is intensity with increasing difficulty, but it is quite bored for player to play with. 
![B parts1](https://github.com/COMP2150-24s1/level-design-assessment-lilfengfeng/assets/106721448/86e6d0d1-f3d8-4744-b413-6f591dacb4f3)
![b parts2](https://github.com/COMP2150-24s1/level-design-assessment-lilfengfeng/assets/106721448/22f20043-ed29-4ca5-8cc4-0666e7b51821)
![B parts3](https://github.com/COMP2150-24s1/level-design-assessment-lilfengfeng/assets/106721448/8eeabddf-6e00-49dc-bc50-964636f1f7f9)

I want my toys interesting for player to explore and learning the basic mechanic. So, I change my design idea, I separate game into three different sections, and for each section there are more encounter inside for player to play with.
I keep the idea of first section, at this point, I want my level simple and distinct, which let player familiar with the core mechanics of this games. After first play test of this section, the design of game flow is much better, with more detailed changes, it perfectly shows the learning of core mechanics right now.
![屏幕截图(96)](https://github.com/COMP2150-24s1/level-design-assessment-lilfengfeng/assets/106721448/ab9fb06f-72a8-43ec-934b-03808d1ee3d4)

And I add two encounters for second sections and third sections. The brief storyboarding diagram really helps me scaffolding my game design, the clear action and experience show in storyboarding, within detailed items and enemies setting inside, this captures my thought of level design, so the game testing shows there isn’t any decreasing of intensity, but the only reason is there is less immediate feedback, so I indicate add in more rewards to attract players’ interest.
![p1 section2](https://github.com/COMP2150-24s1/level-design-assessment-lilfengfeng/assets/106721448/fae93392-977f-435f-be80-b53ef6c1726f)

And another thing I did is, for this section I modified background. It is always a enjoyable, that play game with a memorisable game land view, so I find a big tree as background in this section, this modify the story telling behind the playing as well, and provide interest for player to have a exploration in this open area.
